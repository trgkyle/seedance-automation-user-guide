## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Wait Times:** If you encounter rate limits, increase the **Random Delay** in Settings.
2. **Concurrent Runs:** Start with 1 concurrent prompt and increase slowly to see what your account supports.
3. **Prompting:** Be specific! Detailed prompts lead to better AI generations. Separate multiple prompts with a clear blank line.
4. **File Organization:** Use the **Save to Folder** field to keep project downloads in named subfolders.
5. **Character Images:** Name your image files after characters (e.g., `hero.png`, `villain.jpg`) and enable **Auto-add character images** to have them matched automatically.
6. **Video Duration (Concat):** Use the *concat* duration options (e.g., *6s concat*, *10s concat*) to chain multiple prompts into a single long video. The last prompt always uses a non-concat duration.
7. **Image Chaining (Edit Image):** Use the *Edit Image* mode option to chain image prompts — each prompt's output becomes the next prompt's input.
8. **Quick Fix:** If a generation gets stuck or errors, use the **Fix Error** button in the Control tab.
