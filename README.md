### 🧩 Workflow (Visual Drag-and-Drop Editor)

Workflow is a visual drag-and-drop editor for flows with several steps — for example: generate a few images, then use those images to make videos, then continue each video with another prompt. It opens in its own window and runs on your open Seedance (Dreamina) tab.

#### Open it

* Click **Workflow** in the Control tab (bottom row).
* Already typed prompts or uploaded images in the side panel? Hover **Workflow** and click **Convert to workflow**: your prompts, each prompt's mode and your images become nodes in the editor, ready to run.

#### The screen

| Area | What it holds |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Left** | **Nodes** (click or drag one onto the canvas) and **Your workflows** (all saved workflows) |
| **Top bar** | The canvas tools: Undo/Redo, **Auto arrange**, fit view, **Example**, clear. On the right: the **Details** button, **Shortcuts** and the Seedance (Dreamina) tab status |
| **Canvas** | Your nodes. Top-left: **Run all** (and **Stop** while running) and **Enable background mode** |

The **Details** button shows what needs attention: **Issues (n)** in red/yellow when something blocks a run, **Running 3/8** while generating. Click it to open a panel with the issues (click one to jump to the node), live progress, the run plan and the settings it uses.

#### Nodes

| Node | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enter prompt** | One or more prompts, separated by a **blank line** |
| **Upload image** | Your images (drop files on it). Hover an image: 🔍 to view it larger, ✕ to remove it, the grip in the corner to drag it to another position. The order (or the sort menu) decides which prompt gets which image |
| **Generate Image** | Text to Image, or Image to Image when images are connected. Options: **Image Mode per Prompt**, **Max Input Images per Prompt**, **Auto-add character images** |
| **Generate Video** | Text to Video, or with images connected **Frame to Video** / **Components to Video**. Options: **Video Mode per Prompt**, images per prompt (shared with the side panel settings), **Auto-add character images** (Components to Video) |

Generate nodes are named automatically from their first prompt (`image_…` / `video_…`). Each prompt row shows the images it will receive, so you can check before running. Their preview takes the **aspect ratio** from the settings (a 9:16 node is narrower and taller).

**Frame to Video** can use a start frame only, or a **start frame and end frame** (same setting as the side panel). With start and end frame each prompt takes 2 images in order (a prompt continuing the previous video takes 1); if there are not enough images, the node shows a warning and can't run.

#### Connect nodes

Drag from the round handle on the right of a node and **drop it anywhere on the other node** — the right input is picked for you. Nodes that accept the connection light up while you drag.

| From | To | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Enter prompt | Generate Image / Generate Video | The prompts to generate |
| Upload image | Generate Image / Generate Video | Reference images, start frames or components |
| Generate Image | Generate Image / Generate Video | The **generated images** become that node's input (it runs after the images are ready) |
| Generate Video — **last frame** output | Generate Video | The next video **continues from the last frame** of this one |
| Generate Video — **last frame** output | Generate Image | The **last frame** of each video becomes an input image (it runs after the video is ready) |

#### Run

* **Run all** (top-left, or `Ctrl/⌘ + Enter`) runs the whole workflow in the right order: nodes waiting for generated images start automatically once those images exist.
* If **Run all** is disabled, the top bar shows **Issues (n)**: click it to see what to fix.
* Each Generate node also has its own **Run** button to run only that node. It is disabled until the nodes it depends on have finished (hover to see why).
* **Stop** cancels what is still running.
* While running, the connections into the node that is generating light up and flow, so you can see where the workflow is.

> ⚠️ **Chrome pauses Seedance (Dreamina) when its tab isn't visible** (for example when the workflow window covers it full screen). Click **Enable background mode** (under **Run all** in the workflow, or in the side panel), then pick the Seedance (Dreamina) tab in Chrome's dialog. This shares the Seedance (Dreamina) tab (nothing is recorded or sent anywhere) so it keeps generating behind other windows. The green **Running in background** badge shows it's on; click ✕ to stop it.

#### Results

Results appear inside each Generate node. Hover a result: 🔍 opens it large, ✕ removes it (the eraser clears all results of the node). Videos play on hover. Files are still downloaded as usual.

The next node uses the **first result of each prompt**. To choose which one, drag a result by the grip in its top-left corner onto another result to swap them (images and videos).

#### Manage workflows

Under **Your workflows** (left): **New**, **Import**, and for each workflow the **⋯** menu — **Rename** (or double-click the name), **Duplicate**, **Export**, **Delete**. Everything is saved automatically.

* **Export** downloads a `.json` file. It starts with `//` comment lines that describe every node, property and connection, so you can give the file to an AI assistant and ask it to write new workflows. The comment lines are removed on import.
* **Import** a file with the button, or simply **drag the `.json` file onto the canvas**.

#### Editing shortcuts

Click **Shortcuts** in the top bar (or press `?`) to see them all.

| Action | Keys |
| :--- | :--- |
| Undo / Redo | `Ctrl/⌘ + Z` / `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + Z` |
| Copy / Cut / Paste nodes (also into another workflow) | `Ctrl/⌘ + C / X / V` |
| Duplicate selection | `Ctrl/⌘ + D` |
| Select all / Add to selection / Box select | `Ctrl/⌘ + A` / `Ctrl/⌘ + click` / `Shift + drag` |
| Auto arrange | `Shift + A` |
| Delete selected | `Delete` |
| Run all / Run in background | `Ctrl/⌘ + Enter` / `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + Enter` |

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Wait Times:** If you encounter rate limits, increase the **Random Delay** in Settings.
2. **Concurrent Runs:** Start with 1 concurrent prompt and increase slowly to see what your account supports.
3. **Prompting:** Be specific! Detailed prompts lead to better AI generations. Separate multiple prompts with a clear blank line.
4. **File Organization:** Use the **Save to Folder** field to keep project downloads in named subfolders.
5. **Character Images:** Name your image files after characters (e.g., `hero.png`, `villain.jpg`) and enable **Auto-add character images** to have them matched automatically.
6. **Video Duration (Concat):** Use the *concat* duration options (e.g., *6s concat*, *10s concat*) to chain multiple prompts into a single long video. The last prompt always uses a non-concat duration.
7. **Image Chaining (Edit Image):** Use the *Edit Image* mode option to chain image prompts — each prompt's output becomes the next prompt's input.
8. **Quick Fix:** If a generation gets stuck or errors, use the **Fix Error** button in the Control tab.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Extension not active** | Ensure you are on [dreamina.capcut.com](https://dreamina.capcut.com). Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or F5) if needed. |
| **Generation Errors** | Dreamina might be busy. The extension will automatically retry based on your **Max Retries** setting. Use **Fix Error** to manually recover. |
| **Downloads not working** | Ensure "Ask where to save each file before downloading" is **OFF** in Chrome Settings. |
| **Login Required** | Make sure you are logged into your Dreamina account. |
| **Not enough images** | In Frame-to-Video mode, ensure you have uploaded enough images for the number of prompts and the selected image processing option. |
| **Connection Error** | Refresh the page (Ctrl+R, F5) and try again. If the problem persists, try reinstalling the extension. |
| **Workflow: generation stays at "Generating" forever** | Chrome paused the hidden Seedance (Dreamina) tab. Turn on **Enable background mode** (or **Run in background**), or keep Seedance (Dreamina) visible. |
| **Workflow: a node's Run button is disabled** | Hover it: run the node it depends on first, or fix the issue shown (e.g. no prompt connected). |
| **Workflow: Run all is disabled** | Click **Issues (n)** in the top bar to see what to fix; click an issue to jump to its node. |
| **Workflow: "No Seedance (Dreamina) tab found"** | Open [Seedance (Dreamina)](https://dreamina.capcut.com) in a tab (the green dot in the top bar shows it's connected). |
